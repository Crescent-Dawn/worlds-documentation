# Blender 4.5 to Meta Horizon World Editor Tutorial

Hello everyone, and welcome to our tutorial!  
Today Simulations and I will be showing you how to **create, import, and utilize assets** from **Blender 4.5** into the **Meta Horizon World Editor**.

## Step 1 — Blender Setup

First, hop into Blender and make sure everything is set up properly.  
Install any required libraries, extensions, or quality of life addons you might need or want.

We’ll also include a small flow-chart header on both the video and written tutorial, so if you’re already familiar with certain parts, you can skip ahead.

## Step 2 — Creating an Asset in Blender

You might already have an idea in mind, or maybe you just want to experiment.  
For this tutorial, we’ll create **simple and resource-efficient landscapes** for our Meta Horizon worlds.

### Adding a Landscape

1. Press **`Shift + A`** to open the **Add** menu.  
2. Select **Landscape Generator**.

*This tool is a simple install and helps generate procedural terrain for beginners.*

While in the Landscape Generator, play around with the noise-based settings until you get something you like.  

For this demo, we’re making desert canyons to fit a *James Bond villain* style suspended house inside a canyon.

## Step 3 — Refining with Voronoi

Use the **Voronoi generator** to make canyon
