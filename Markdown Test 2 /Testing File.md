# Hello everyone, and welcome to our tutorial! Today, Simulations and I will be showcasing how to create assets in blender, and then how to import and utilize them in Meta Horizon’s very own Desktop World Editor!!

## 1st Introduction Thingy

This tutorial will be split up into seven – that’s right seven phases! And if you order now we’ll throw in an extra feature never before seen, VIDEO!! (wow) Just call this number: 1-800-1111-111 and ask for the secrets of the universe, and our company will ship them right to you! Don’t wait, don’t delay, call now!

## 2nd Introduction Thingy

This tutorial will be split into 7 phases, each phase denoted by a various color to help with Identification! If you’re already familiar with a specific part of the tutorial, these phases will allow you to skip ahead to the parts that you might be struggling with. If you’re mostly familiar with the specifics, but need a refresher on the overall process, there will also be a recap flowchart attached to phase 7 that will allow users to rapidly run through the tutorial as well. With the formalities out of the way, let’s get started!

### Phase 1 - The Set-up (Freeze dirtbag!!! *pew* *pew*) 

For phase one of this tutorial, we will split it into two sections: Installing Blender, and Installing Meta Horizons Desktop World Editor

I’ll take over phase 1, and then pass on the mic to my partner in crime, Simulations, so she can guide you into installing MHDWE!

**Part 1 - The Install**

Much like a real life blender, Blender (the software) gives the users a lot of creative freedom on what they can chop up! In this tutorial specifically, we’ll be making (Insert thing that we decide on here), and so we’ll do a mostly normal Blender install, with some slight tweaks here and there to make things easier for new users. 

Firstly, you’ll want to head here, and install the latest version of Blender available, or find the specific version you might want to use. (as of writing this, Blender is currently at 4.5.2 LTS) I've included a screencap of what the download screen should look like below:

Once downloaded, find the installer file, open it, and install it like you would any other software! 

While that's installing, now is also a good time to grab the Horizon Worlds Desktop Editor, and install it in a similar fashion. I've included a screenshot below for reference:
